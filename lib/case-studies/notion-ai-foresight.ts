  // Executive Summary
  executiveSummary: {
    atAGlance: [
      "The bet: the raw signal for delivery foresight already sits inside Notion's content; no new integrations needed to surface it.",
      'The MVP: one signal type (status-language detection), full explainability on every flag, an auto-generated status digest, unified pricing. No autonomous actions.',
      'The north star: % of Business tier workspaces where Foresight measurably cuts duplicated status work, without a drop in engagement.',
      'Short on time? Sections 4 (vision), 5 (RICE), and 6 (PRD) carry the core argument; everything else is supporting depth.'
    ],
    overview: `Notion AI today is excellent at helping people write, drafting, summarising, and rewriting content inside a page. It is not yet able to tell a team whether its work is actually on track. That gap is costing Notion real revenue: teams that need delivery foresight are paying for a second tool (ClickUp Brain, at $7-9/user/month) or, at the enterprise level, for Glean's enterprise search (roughly $45-50/user/month), more than double what Notion Business costs.

This case study proposes Notion Foresight: a new capability that reasons across the docs, comments, and database fields a team already keeps in Notion to surface delivery risk and decision drift before they become a crisis, with every signal traceable back to its source.

The MVP is deliberately narrow: one signal type (status language detection), full explainability on every flag, an auto-generated status digest, and unified Business tier pricing with autonomous actions explicitly held back until trust is earned.

The core bet: Notion's advantage isn't out-integrating Glean or out-executing ClickUp; it's that the raw signal for foresight is already sitting inside content Notion already owns.`

  // Problem section
  problem: {
    statement: "Notion's AI can help you write about your work, but can't tell you whether your work is on track",
    context: `Notion AI currently competes in three categories at once: all-in-one workspace (docs + wiki + light PM), AI-native task and PM execution, and enterprise "Work AI" / knowledge OS. This ambiguity is itself the strategic problem.

Notion's strongest wedge remains writing: users can select between GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3. Where it stays thin is anything requiring Notion to reason across a workspace rather than one page.`,
